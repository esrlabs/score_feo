//! Provides a convenience macro creating ffi definitions and Rust glue code for C++ components

/// Create ffi definitions and Rust glue code for a C++ component

/// Call: `cpp_activity!(name, library)`
///
/// Arguments:
/// - name: name prefix of C-functions exported by the C++ library
/// - step_params: List of parameters expected by the step function, use `()` if none.
/// - library: Name of the library containing the C-functions
///
/// The C++ code is expected to reside in the given library and provide C-linkable functions
/// named
/// - `<name>_create`,
